## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

The motivation in creating the Guide was as a way of synthesising the large amount of new information presented to students. The Prework is a way of introducing inexperienced coders to a few key concepts in full stack web development. This Prework Study Guide therefore takes this introduction and breaks it down further. Boot camp students can refer to it as they further add to their knowledge base.

It can be hard to know where to begin study. As such, a topic selector was built into the webpage.
