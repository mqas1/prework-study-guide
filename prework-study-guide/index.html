        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</i> is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage: text elements; image elements; header elements; list elements.</li>
          <li>Common element types that are used to divide and describe the page: meta-related elements; content division elements; semantic elements.</li>  
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> declaration tells the browser what document type it should exptect, i.e. HTML.</li>
          <li><b>html</b> opening tag represents the root, or start, of the HTML document. It can have an attribute inside the tag, e.g. <b>lang="en"</b>, which tells the browser the language of the webpage.</li>
          <li>An <b>HTML attribute</b> defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li><b>meta</b> tags always go inside the <b>head</b> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for SEO.</li>  
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li><b>`charset`</b> is character set, UTF-8 is recommended.</li>
          <li><b>`http-equip`</b> element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The <b>`viewport`</b> element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements</b>. The element that holds all the children is known as the <b>parent element</b>.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element is an example of a <b>semantic HTML element</b>. Semantic HTML elements are elements where the name describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is a good practise to use semantic HTML as it makes it easier to read for other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li><b>div</b> to create a division in the page.</li>
          <li><b>span</b> to create an inline division.</li>
          <li><b>ul</b> = unordered list; <b>ol</b> = ordered list; <b>li</b> = list item.</li>
          <li><b>img</b> attribute <b>`src`</b> (location/source, eg url) is most important. <b>`alt`</b> attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers as well as SEO.</li>
          <li>Should only have one <b>h1</b> heading per page.</li>
          <li><b>footer</b> element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li><b>section</b> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>HTML uses <b>`id`</b> attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Three types of CSS: inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>Inline is within a specific HTML tag and is the least flexible of options.</li>
          <li>An internal stylesheet can be embedded as as <b>style</b> element in the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are the most common method and are connected to the HTML with a <b>link</b> element in the <b>head</b> element.</li>
          <li>A CSS Rule contains a selector and declarations, where a selector defines the element or attribute and the declarations contain the CSS property with its value.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>Use wildcard selector, or *, to apply a rule for all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A period (.) before an element designates it as a class selector whereby any HTML element assigned to that class will gain those property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands are different to bash commands. They are used to save and track versions of code.</li>
          <li>Using git commands we can initiate or create a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git can track changes locally. GitHub is cloud based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li><b>Branches</b> are workspaces where you can make changes that don’t affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you’re making a commit — adds changes to your branch.</li>
          <li>We shouldn’t do any coding directly in the <b>main</b> branch, instead we create a <b>feature</b> branch, which is a copy of the main branch.</li>
          <li><b>Feature</b> because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app.</li>
          <li>In the feature branch we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working — add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code.</li>
          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repository within feature branch.</li>
          <li>Merge changes into main branch with pull request.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message": saves a new version of the file we are working on. Write imperative command in the present tense.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: adds ("pulls") the current main branch from the repo to our local environment.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: adds ("pushes") our changes in the local environment to the repo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li><b>String</b>: a sequence of text where the value is enclosed in single quote marks.</li>
          <li><b>Number</b>: a number without quotes around them.</li>
          <li><b>Boolean</b>: true/false value.</li>
          <li><b>Array</b>: a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li><b>Object</b>: can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>An <b>operator</b> is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).</li>
          <li>Start by declaring a variable with the <b>let</b> keyword.</li>
          <li>Whereas the style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the body element.</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not.</li>
          <li>Instead of repeatedly writing the same code you can define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in the code.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>Primitive values are immutable, i.e. cannot be changed — all types except objects.</li>
          <li><b>Null</b> values represent the intentional absence of any object value.</li>
          <li>All primitive types — except null and undefined — have their corresponding object wrapper types. When a property is accessed on a primitive value, JavaScript automatically wraps the value into the corresponding wrapper object and accesses the property on the object instead.</li>
          <li><b>Undefined</b> indicates the absence of a value, while <b>null</b> indicates the absence of an object.</li>
          <li>The <b>BigInt</b> type is a numeric primitive type that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude.</li>
          <li>With <b>BigInts</b> you can safely store and operate on large integers event beyond the <b><i>safe integer limit</i></b>.</li>
          <li>Create <b>BigInts</b> by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the <b>BigInt()</b> function.</li>
          <li>JavaScript <b>strings</b> are immutable.</li>
          <li>A symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property. The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code.</li>
          <li>In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier. In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being <i>callable</i>.</li>
          <li>There are two types of object properties: the data property and the accessor property. Each property has corresponding attributes.</li>
          <li>Data properties associate a key with a value.</li>
          <li>An accessor property associates one of two accessor functions (get and set) to retrieve or store a value.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement act the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>JavaScript arrays are zero indexed, which is to say the fist item has an index of [0], n+1 every other item.</li>
          <li>Arrays have a special property called <b>length</b>, which is equal to the number of items in the array.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function declaration uses the function keyword and function name to define a function.</li>
          <li>Need to call the function to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function’s name is followed by parenthesis.</li>
