        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</i> is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage: text elements; image elements; header elements; list elements.</li>
          <li>Common element types that are used to divide and describe the page: meta-related elements; content division elements; semantic elements.</li>  
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> declaration tells the browser what document type it should exptect, i.e. HTML.</li>
          <li><b>html</b> opening tag represents the root, or start, of the HTML document. It can have an attribute inside the tag, e.g. <b>lang="en"</b>, which tells the browser the language of the webpage.</li>
          <li>An <b>HTML attribute</b> defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li><b>meta</b> tags always go inside the <b>head</b> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.</li>
          <li>The <b>title</b> element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for SEO.</li>  
          <li>The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li><b>`charset`</b> is character set, UTF-8 is recommended.</li>
          <li><b>`http-equip`</b> element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
          <li>The <b>`viewport`</b> element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called <b>child elements</b>. The element that holds all the children is known as the <b>parent element</b>.</li>
          <li>The <b>body</b> element is an example of a <b>semantic HTML element</b>. Semantic HTML elements are elements where the name describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>It is a good practise to use semantic HTML as it makes it easier to read for other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li><b>div</b> to create a division in the page.</li>
          <li><b>span</b> to create an inline division.</li>
          <li><b>ul</b> = unordered list; <b>ol</b> = ordered list; <b>li</b> = list item.</li>
          <li><b>img</b> attribute <b>`src`</b> (location/source, eg url) is most important. <b>`alt`</b> attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
          <li>The alt text is important for screen readers as well as SEO.</li>
          <li>Should only have one <b>h1</b> heading per page.</li>
          <li><b>footer</b> element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li><b>section</b> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>HTML uses <b>`id`</b> attribute as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Three types of CSS: inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>Inline is within a specific HTML tag and is the least flexible of options.</li>
          <li>An internal stylesheet can be embedded as as <b>style</b> element in the <b>head</b> element of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External stylesheets are the most common method and are connected to the HTML with a <b>link</b> element in the <b>head</b> element.</li>
          <li>A CSS Rule contains a selector and declarations, where a selector defines the element or attribute and the declarations contain the CSS property with its value.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>Use wildcard selector, or *, to apply a rule for all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A period (.) before an element designates it as a class selector whereby any HTML element assigned to that class will gain those property assignments from the CSS.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git commands are different to bash commands. They are used to save and track versions of code.</li>
          <li>Using git commands we can initiate or create a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Git can track changes locally. GitHub is cloud based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li><b>Branches</b> are workspaces where you can make changes that don’t affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you’re making a commit — adds changes to your branch.</li>
          <li>We shouldn’t do any coding directly in the <b>main</b> branch, instead we create a <b>feature</b> branch, which is a copy of the main branch.</li>
          <li><b>Feature</b> because we are adding a new feature or functionality to our app.</li>
          <li>In the feature branch we make commits of all the changes we make to the code while working — add a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code.</li>
          <li>Then we push up the changes to our feature branch in our GitHub repository within feature branch.</li>
          <li>Merge changes into main branch with pull request.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message": saves a new version of the file we are working on. Write imperative command in the present tense.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: adds ("pulls") the current main branch from the repo to our local environment.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: adds ("pushes") our changes in the local environment to the repo.</li>
        </ul>
